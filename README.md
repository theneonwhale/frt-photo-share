# Photo share app
Introducing a robust application that offers a secure and interactive platform for photo sharing. With features like JWT token-based authentication, three distinct user roles, and the ability to manage photos by viewing, downloading, and deleting them, users can easily organize their visual memories. Moreover, users can enhance their photos, add tags and descriptions, generate QR codes for easy sharing, engage in comments and ratings, while admins and moderators maintain control over user interactions and ratings.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Poetry

## Installation
1. Clone the project repository:
```
git clone <repository_url>
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd <project_directory>
```
3. Install the project dependencies using Poetry:
```
poetry install
```
Poetry will create a virtual environment and install the required packages specified in the pyproject.toml file.

## Launching
To launch the development server and start the FastAPI project, follow these steps:

1. Activate the project's virtual environment:
```
poetry shell
```
2. Run the following command to start the development server:
```
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
- ```main``` refers to the name of the main file where your FastAPI app instance is created.
- ```--reload``` enables auto-reloading of the server whenever code changes are detected (useful during development).
3. Once the server has started, you should see output similar to the following:

```
INFO: Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```
Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000 to access the API.
